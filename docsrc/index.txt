=================================================

This API is publicly available, it is dependant on the CSD python API - a commercial package.
If you are an academic user, it's likely your institution will have a license. If you are unsure if you have a
license or would like to enquire about purchasing one, please contact support@ccdc.cam.ac.uk


Please note, this is an academic project and we would therefore welcome feedback, contributions and collaborations.
If you have any queries regarding this package please contact us (pcurran@ccdc.cam.ac.uk)!


NB: We recommend installing on a Linux machine. If this isn't possible, be aware that only the LIGSITE method will be
available for the buriedness calculation.
