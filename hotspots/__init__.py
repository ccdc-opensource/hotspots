# Unfortunately RDKit and matplotlib are both linked to specific underlying 
# versions of compiled libraries. The CCDC code is less fussy, but this means if
# these modules are imported after CCDC modules the imports of rdkit & matplolib 
# can fail depending on the exact version of the underlying library pulled in
# if it happens the version the CCDC import pulled in was one that they dont work with.
